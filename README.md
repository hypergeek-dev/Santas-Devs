**Card Generator - creating the card**

- A Bootstrap carousel displays background images for user selection via a dropdown menu.
- The input options allow a user to add a recipient, greeting message and a sender.
- The chosen background and text can be viewed as a preview window using HTML canvas.
- The chosen design - both image and text can be seen in real-time.
- Users can add text and change text before being ready to share.
- Once ready they, can click the share button to get a shareable link. 


**Card Generator - Sharing the card using a link**

When the user clicks the 'create link' button on the card generator form, a 
link is created containing the encoded form field values which the user can 
send to the recipient to share the card.  

When the recipient follows the link, their card and personalised message are 
displayed.
